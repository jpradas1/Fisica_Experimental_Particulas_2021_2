## Tracks and Clusters
### Exercise 1 & 2 
> We make three histograms through the 'TC_Ex1_2_macro.cpp file', so these graphs are as following:
![](Tracks_Clusters/mu_mean.png)

>These 3 histogram are about 1. Number of average interaction per bunch-crossing (Events vs mu_average) 2. Number of primary vertices per event (Events vs NPV) and 3. A 2D histogram to analyze the number of primary vertices per number of average interaction (NPV vs mu_average)
